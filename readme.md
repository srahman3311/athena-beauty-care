// Important notes about Google Calendar API integration

1. Use Google Chrome for calendar integration part. It's ok to use other browsers to interact with the application but
must use Google Chrome for calendar integration. Otherwise it may behave unexpectedly. Because Google has a heavy security
measures set up. 
2. I a user doesn't give access to his/her google calendar with a certain gmail account then that gmail account must not be 
used for future integration. Google will save the data and application may behave unexpectedly.
